Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app - Nightlife Coordination App

**User Stories:**

  1. As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area
  2. As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight
  3. As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there
  4. As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again
